# Pocket Project

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

For now, you need to have the DBManager clone on your local machine. 
Follow all the steps that are in the DBManager's readme, except that you don't have to run it (**but you still have to build it** using `mvn clean install`)

### Running

1. Start Elasticsearch Instance

*(Go to project root)*

`mvn clean install`
`mvn spring-boot:run`

## Deployment
