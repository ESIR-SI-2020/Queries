# Pocket Project

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

For now, you need to clone the DomainAndDatabases repository on your local machine. 
Follow all the steps that are in the DomainAndDatabases's readme, except that you don't have to run it (**but you still have to build it** using `mvn clean install`)

### Running

1. Start Elasticsearch Instance

*(Go to project root)*

`mvn clean install`
`mvn spring-boot:run`

## Graphql 

You can find postman queries and mutations examples `graphql.postman_collection.json` in the `resources/graphql` folder.
To import it, go to postman and File -> Import... -> Import file and drop the `graphql.postman_collection.json` file.
