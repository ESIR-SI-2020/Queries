# Pocket Project

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

Follow all the steps that are in the DBManager's readme, except that you don't have to run it (**but you still have to build it** using `mvn clean install`)
